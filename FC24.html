      <h2>EA Sports FC 24 Review:</h2>
      <article class="news-item">
        <p>
          Although EA Sports decided to change the title of their game we're still faced with the same identity of its predecessors, a fantastic, competitive sports game with added freshness. Gameplay is familiar yet fresh, by adding RPG elements like "Superpowered Cards" and various "Playstyles" however,
          even with such additions the game feels more like an update and less like a new release which is very much to the games detriment. That isn't to say its bad, very much the opposite, it follows it's tried and true formula but puts a spin on things in regards to new gameplay mechanics, a better 
          management system to collect new cards or players and fresh graphics which make the game feel alive with new , fluid animations, "HyperMotion V" which creates almost realistic gameplay and a better passing system. 
        </p>
        <p>Although it isn't a perfect football simulator, its still highly enjoyable and refreshing to see EA take certain risks with their already popular franchise</p>

        <h4>Summary:</h4>    
    <p>
      
      Although not anything new to the gaming space, EA Sports FC 24 still stands tall as a new addition, allowing users to play as a plethora of worldwide players with no regards to gender, equalising all stats so there's no difference between male or female. On the pitch all are created equal. 
      It allows for the creation of one's all-star dream team (depending on your luck with the card packs however). New features give the game a shine with HyperMotion V allowing for hyperrealistic action which increases immersion, so footbal fanatics be warned, you may want to set an alarm to put 
      down those controllers
