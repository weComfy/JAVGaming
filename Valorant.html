        <p>Spanning 25 rounds the game places players in 5v5 teams where they have to either attack or defend. With unique skills relevant to their class, Attackers have to safely plant their bombs and defend it by decimating all opposing players and Defenders have to try and defuse said bomb
        while also trying to clear the map of other players. Before each match starts players have the opportunity to purchase skill and guns that will help them achieve victory. Outside of the matches players can also achieve unique customisations for weapons through the shop, allowing for a singular

          <h4> Summary:</h4>
          <p> This is all to say that Valorant, although a relatively new addition to the gaming space is slowly but surely cementing itself as a titan-titled game for lovers of the FPS genre. With slick designs and fast-paced gunsblazing action it is simply a delight to enjoy. Although long-winded 
              with 25 rounds to play in a single match not all matches are created equal, with different modes including Deathmatch, Swift Play and many more players, especially the time-conscious, can enjoy short bursts of adrenaline and dopamine to get their fix in. With this what we have in our hands 
              is vast and diverse well-excecuted shooter made with the gamer in mind </p>
